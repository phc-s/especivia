## About project üöô: 

Especivia is a concept project of a startup, which focuses on creating a mobile app that brings a platform where private drivers of a variety of vehicles, alongside disabled people can reunite on the special app that allows connections between them, both in particular and B2B models, Opportunities and charity through this all-new innovative idea of a platform, that ensures security, quality and affordability!

This app started as an integrated project, with initially the help of my teachers of Technical Course of Development Systems in ETE Cicero Dias. This project will proceed further beyond this technical course. Since i`m really interested into it, for while, i do not plan this being reality for now.
