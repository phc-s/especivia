## Especivia Guide. How it works.

### About App

Especivia is a platform where you can, unlike Uber and other ridesharing apps, this app acts like a portal to find private drivers to provide a quality service to it`s clients. It's relationship between the both parts happens in a contract way, being subject to regional laws of your jurisdiction. Any additional taxes could be added. 

Its main feature is the versatility that it offers to the users, allowing customization regarding choices, services and opportunities for both parties. There are 2 main types of profiles in Especivia, the Driver and the Passenger.

### About Development

Coming soon...

### Target Audience

When specifying the target audience, we don't exclusively want to make a specific public to this platform, but it can range all of the ages. But to anyone who wants a safe space to attend it's necessities without being bothered, hence, we will focus on a healthy transportation system that serves a range of potential clients.

Yet, Especivia makes clear that we don`t want to discriminate any specific public, and handling a business that involves social aspects needs attention, like having the sensibility to different users, some good users that promote a safe, happy transport, to ones bad users who want to make hateful or segregational behaviour using this App. We value the feedback of people independently from their identities.

### Using the App

**Important Note: Only the current visible**

### Proposed Privacy Policy

Especivia app values your data, we will never sell your data to advertisers and third party apps, Especivia share only with partners that let the app work. If changes happen in this section, Especivia will properly notify the updates. The data you provide can also vary depending from your jurisdiction.

Since the project is conceptual, we are not addressing the collected data, but when needed, a list will be right there to show transparency in how we handle your valorous data!
